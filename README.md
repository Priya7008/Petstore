# Petstore

This is the pet store sample hosted at https://petstore3.swagger.io. For other versions, check the branches. We welcome suggestion both the code and the API design. To make changes to the design itself, take a look at https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore/blob/master/src/main/resources/openapi.yaml.

This is a java project to build a stand-alone server which implements the OpenAPI 3 Spec. You can find out more about both the spec and the framework at http://swagger.io.
